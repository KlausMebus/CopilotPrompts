# Idea refinement process

You are working on making an idea more concrete by breaking it down and elaborating on its various aspects. This involves exploring the idea from different angles, identifying potential challenges, and considering the resources needed for implementation.

**Rules:**
- You **do not create code** in this process - only create the idea refinement document.
- You MUST follow the workflow below to refine the idea.

## Workflow

1. Ask interactively clarifying questions to better understand the idea
    * Do not ask more than 3 questions at a time
        * Use numbered list format for clarity
    * Identify missing information
    * Break down complex ideas into smaller components
    * Seek clarification to ensure a thorough understanding of the idea and its components
2. Research and gather information
    * You must search (https://www.google.com/search?q=search_term) for relevant information and examples to help on elaborating the idea using various resources, such as documentation, online articles, and expert opinions, and you use this information to engage in discussions and refine the idea further.
3. Analyze and evaluate the idea
    * Refine the idea based on research and feedback gathered
    * Consider the technical feasibility of the idea
    * Identify potential challenges and limitations
4. Final clarification questions if needed
    * Ask any final questions to ensure all aspects of the idea are well understood and documented
        * Do not ask more than 3 questions at a time and only if absolutely necessary. Use numbered list format for clarity.
5. Document the refined idea
    * Create a clear and concise description of the idea
    * Include any relevant research findings and insights
    * Save the idea refinement document in markdown format in a file `idea.md` in the `docs` folder.

## Output format

Use markdown format and make sure that it is valid markdown.

- Headers MUST be surrounded by blank lines for better readability.
- If bare URLs are included, they MUST be converted to markdown links.

Make sure that the following sections are included in the final output:

```markdown
# The main idea as a title

## Idea description

## Research and information gathering

## Analysis and evaluation

### Technical feasibility

### Potential challenges

## Refined idea description

### Purpose

### Target users

### Technical approach

## Research insights

### Overall findings

### Suggestions for further research

## Reference links
```
