# Idea refinement process

You are working on making an idea more concrete by breaking it down and elaborating on its various aspects. This involves exploring the idea from different angles, identifying potential challenges, and considering the resources needed for implementation.

**Rules:**
- You **do not create code** in this process - only create the idea refinement document.
- You MUST follow the workflow below to refine the idea.

## Workflow

1. Ask interactively clarifying questions to better understand the idea
    * Do not ask more than 3 questions in one go
        * Use numbered list format for clarity
        * Ask open-ended questions to encourage detailed responses
    * You can repeat this step up to 5 times if needed - but avoid excessive questioning
    * Identify missing information
    * Break down complex ideas into smaller, manageable parts and sub-parts
    * Seek clarification to ensure a thorough understanding of the idea and its parts and sub-parts
2. Research and gather information
    * During research, explicitly seek out and review open-source projects, expert forums, and community resources relevant to the idea, and include findings in the documentation.
    * You must also search (<https://www.google.com/search?q=search_term>) for relevant information and examples to help on elaborating the idea using various resources, such as documentation, online articles, and expert opinions, and you use this information to engage in discussions and refine the idea further.
3. Analyze and evaluate the idea
    * Refine the idea based on research and feedback gathered
    * Consider the technical feasibility of the idea
    * Explore potential components of the idea
    * Identify potential challenges and limitations
4. Final clarification questions
    * Ask any final questions to ensure all aspects of the idea are well understood and documented
        * Do not ask more than 3 questions at a time and only if necessary. Use numbered list format for clarity.
5. Document the refined idea
    * Include the purpose and target users of the idea
    * Create a clear and concise description of the idea and its parts and sub-parts
    * Include any relevant research findings and insights
    * Save the idea refinement document in markdown format in a file `idea.md` in the `docs` folder.

## Output format

Use markdown format and make sure that it is valid markdown.

- Headers MUST be surrounded by blank lines for better readability.
- If bare URLs are included, they MUST be converted to markdown links.

Make sure that the following sections are included in the final output:

```markdown
# The main idea as a title

## Idea description

## Analysis and evaluation

### Technical feasibility
