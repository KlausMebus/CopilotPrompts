# Idea refinement process

You are working on making an idea more concrete by breaking it down and elaborating on its various aspects. This involves exploring the idea from different angles, identifying potential challenges, and considering the resources needed for implementation.

**Goal:** Create a detailed and structured description of the idea, including its purpose, target users, functionality, components, and their interactions.

*Rules:*
- You **do not create code** in this process - only create the idea refinement document.
- You MUST follow the workflow mentioned below to refine the idea.

## Analysis perspectives

**You must analyze the idea from at least two perspectives:**
- Its functionality and behavior (what it does, how it acts, what outcomes it produces)
- Its logical or physical components/structure (how it is organized, what parts it consists of, and how these parts interact)

**You must also consider the relationship between these two perspectives:**
- How does the intended functionality or behavior influence the design or organization of components?
- How do the logical or physical components enable, constrain, or shape the functionality and behavior?

## Workflow

0. In for each of the following steps, you MUST ask clarifying questions to better understand the idea or any related aspects. 
    - Do not ask more than 3 questions at a time. 
    - Use numbered list format for clarity.
    - You can repeat this question step up to 5 times if needed - but avoid excessive questioning
1. Pick a focus area for the analysis perspective you want to start with (a functionality/behavior or a components/structure)
    - Search for relevant information and examples
    - During this research, explicitly seek out and review open-source projects, expert forums, and community resources relevant to the idea, and include findings in the documentation.
    - You must also search (<https://www.google.com/search?q=search_term> where "search_term" is replaced with specific keywords related to the idea) for relevant information and examples to help on elaborating the idea using various resources, such as documentation, online articles, and expert opinions
    - Break down the focus area into smaller parts and sub-parts
    - Identify any missing information or areas that need further clarification
    - When a focus area in this way have been sufficiently explored including broken down into smaller parts, move to the other perspective and repeat the process
2. Analyze and evaluate the idea
    - Refine the idea based on research and feedback gathered, and on the breakdown into parts
    - Consider the technical feasibility of the idea
3. Explore the relationship between the perspectives
    - Explicitly examine and describe the relationship between perspectives (e.g., how components support or limit functionality, and how desired behaviors affect component design).
    - Identify potential challenges and limitations
4. Final clarification questions
    - Ask any final questions to ensure all aspects of the idea are well understood and documented
5. Document the refined idea in a structured format as described in the "Output format" section below
    - Save the idea refinement document in markdown format in a file `idea.md` in the `docs` folder.

## Output format

Use markdown format and make sure that it is valid markdown.

- Headers MUST be surrounded by blank lines for better readability.
- If bare URLs are included, they MUST be converted to markdown links.

Make sure that the following sections are included in the final output:

```markdown
